## About
Often we face issues that there is not a scalable in browser video streaming platform that is decentralised. So we have created a video sharing platform for users and creators to share resources and content. The name of project is OxPlore. It is built on top of Polygon Network and Graph and has used Livepeer for providing video streaming facilities. OxPlore is built using nextjs for front end, Smart contracts: Solidity, Ethereum web client library: Ethers.js, File storage: IPFS
Querying data: The Graph, CSS Framework: TailwindCSS, Ethereum development environment: Hardhat, Layer 2 blockchain: Polygon, Video Infrastructure: Livepeer

## Functionality & Concepts
- People can share their video contents and live stream freely without any restrictions.
- Cheaper than other streaming and content sharing platform(No adsense).
- Eazily scalable and minimal down time.


## Future scope
- Ways to incentivize both the user and the content creator.
- Streamer will start the video streaming with minimum streaming time (10-20min) along with some stake ammount.
- Followers of that particular streamer will have the option to add streaming time by pooling some very small token amount . If the streamer is able to stream upto the time that users have increased , the streamer can take the pooled in amount or else streamers stake will be distributed among users.
- Posts added by the content creators will be interactable.They can add claimable NFT ,airdrops etc.
- People can run charity streams to get donation amount from the user(better than other platforms because we won't charge any amount from the content creators for streaming).
